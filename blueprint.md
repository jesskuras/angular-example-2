# Packing List Application Blueprint

## Overview

A simple and intuitive application for creating and managing packing lists. Users can add items, assign them to categories, and check them off as they pack.

## Features

*   **Add Items**: Quickly add new items to your packing list.
*   **Categorize**: Organize items by category (e.g., "Clothes", "Toiletries").
*   **Check Off**: Mark items as packed.
*   **Persistence**: Your list is saved automatically in your browser.
*   **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Core Functionality

1.  **Project Setup**: Create a new standalone Angular application.
2.  **Component Structure**:
    *   `app.component`: The main application shell.
    *   `packing-list.component`: The main component that will display the packing list, and allow users to add and manage items.
3.  **Data Model**: Define an interface for a `PackingItem` with `id`, `name`, `category`, and `packed` properties.
4.  **State Management**: Use a signal-based service to manage the packing list items.
5.  **Initial UI**:
    *   Create a simple form for adding new items.
    *   Display the list of items.
